# Execution History Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Agent Execution History feature, which provides a persistent record of all tasks executed by agent groups. This feature is distinct from agent memory and allows users to track, review, and continue from past executions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Model Changes

#### 1.1 AgentGroup Class Extension

The `AgentGroup` class has been extended to include an execution history array and related methods:

```python
class AgentGroup:
    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
        description: str,
        id: Optional[str] = None,
        agents: Optional[List[Agent]] = None,
        shared_memory: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
        execution_history: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
        created_at: Optional[str] = None,
    ):
        # Other properties...
        self.execution_history = execution_history or []
        
    def add_to_history(self, entry: Dict[str, Any]):
        """
        Add an execution entry to the group's history.
        """
        # Add timestamp and ID if not present
        if "timestamp" not in entry:
            entry["timestamp"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
        
        if "id" not in entry:
            entry["id"] = str(uuid.uuid4())
            
        self.execution_history.append(entry)
        
        # Trim history if it gets too large (keep last 100 entries)
        if len(self.execution_history) > 100:
            self.execution_history = self.execution_history[-100:]
        
        return entry["id"]
```

#### 1.2 Serialization Support

The serialization methods were updated to include history:

```python
def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        # Other properties...
        "execution_history": self.execution_history,
    }

@classmethod
def from_dict(cls, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> "AgentGroup":
    return cls(
        # Other properties...
        execution_history=data.get("execution_history", []),
    )
```

### 2. History Recording

History is now recorded for all execution types:

#### 2.1 Manager Execution

```python
# In execute_task_with_manager method
history_entry = {
    "type": "manager_execution",
    "task": task,
    "agents_involved": [step["agent"] for step in plan["steps"]],
    "result": {
        "status": "success",
        "plan": plan,
        "results": results,
        "summary": summary,
        "outcome": outcome,
        "next_steps": next_steps
    }
}
self.add_to_history(history_entry)
```

#### 2.2 Single Agent Execution

```python
# In execute_with_agent function
history_entry = {
    "type": "single_agent_execution",
    "task": task,
    "agents_involved": [agent_name],
    "result": {
        "status": "success",
        "response": result.get("response", ""),
        "thought_process": result.get("thought_process", ""),
        "tool_calls": result.get("tool_calls", [])
    },
    "execution_time": execution_time
}
group.add_to_history(history_entry)
```

#### 2.3 Directive Execution

```python
# In execute_task_with_directives function
history_entry = {
    "type": "directive_execution",
    "task": task,
    "directives": directives,
    "agents_involved": agents_involved,
    "result": {
        "status": "success",
        "response": combined_response,
        "agent_results": combined_results
    },
    "execution_time": execution_time
}
group.add_to_history(history_entry)
```

### 3. UI Components

#### 3.1 History Tab

A new "Execution History" tab has been added to the group view:

```python
def render_group_view(group: AgentGroup):
    # Add tabs for group details, task execution, and history
    group_tab, task_tab, history_tab = st.tabs([
        "Group Details", 
        "Task Execution",
        "Execution History"
    ])
    
    # ... other tabs ...
    
    with history_tab:
        # Render the execution history UI
        render_execution_history(group)
```

#### 3.2 History View Component

The history view includes:

- Filtering options by execution type and agent
- Sorting options (newest/oldest first)
- Expandable entries with detailed execution information
- Continuation capability from any history entry

```python
def render_execution_history(group: AgentGroup):
    """Render the execution history for an agent group."""
    # Filtering controls (type, agent, sorting)
    
    # Display history entries
    for i, entry in enumerate(filtered_history):
        # Format and display entry in expander
        
        # Display different content based on execution type
        if entry_type == "manager_execution":
            # Show plan, results, summary tabs
        elif entry_type == "single_agent_execution":
            # Show thought process, response, tools
        elif entry_type == "directive_execution":
            # Show directives and individual results
        
        # Add continuation button
        if st.button("Prepare Continuation from This", key=f"cont_{expander_key}"):
            prepare_continuation_from_history(entry)
```

#### 3.3 Continuation from History

Users can continue from any history entry with context preserved:

```python
def prepare_continuation_from_history(history_entry: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Prepare a continuation from a history entry."""
    # Format result based on execution type
    
    continuation_prompt = f"""Previous task: {task}
    
Result:
{formatted_result}

Continue from here:
"""
    
    # Set in session state
    st.session_state.current_task = continuation_prompt
    st.session_state.in_continuation_mode = True
    
    # If it's a single agent execution, pre-select that agent
    if entry_type == "single_agent_execution" and history_entry.get("agents_involved"):
        st.session_state.target_agent = history_entry["agents_involved"][0]
    
    # Rerun to show the continuation interface
    st.rerun()
```

### 4. History Entry Structure

Each history entry follows this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "unique_uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-format timestamp",
  "type": "manager_execution|single_agent_execution|directive_execution",
  "task": "Original task text",
  "agents_involved": ["agent1", "agent2"],
  "result": {
    "status": "success|error",
    "response": "Response text for single agent/directive executions",
    "thought_process": "Reasoning for single agent executions",
    "plan": {},  // For manager executions
    "results": [],  // For manager executions
    "summary": "",  // For manager executions 
    "outcome": "",  // For manager executions
    "agent_results": []  // For directive executions
  },
  "execution_time": 1.23,  // Execution time in seconds
  "directives": {}  // For directive executions
}
```

## Benefits and Features

### 1. Persistent Record

The history feature provides a persistent record of all agent interactions, surviving across sessions and application restarts. This creates a continuous thread of agent activity that can be referenced, analyzed, and built upon.

### 2. Multi-dimensional Filtering

Users can filter history by:
- Execution type (Manager, Single Agent, Directive)
- Specific agent involvement
- Chronological order (newest/oldest first)

### 3. Detailed Context Preservation

Each history entry preserves:
- The original task
- Which agents were involved
- The complete execution results
- Execution metadata (timestamp, execution time)

### 4. Continuations from Any Point

The system allows users to continue from any point in the history, not just the most recent execution. This creates a non-linear workflow where users can:
- Branch from earlier executions
- Create alternative continuations
- Return to previous work
- Experiment with different approaches from the same starting point

### 5. Execution Analysis

The detailed view of each history entry enables:
- Analysis of agent reasoning
- Comparison of different execution approaches
- Identification of patterns in agent behavior
- Tracking of task evolution over time

## User Experience

The history feature is presented as a dedicated tab in the agent group view, making it easily accessible without cluttering the primary task execution interface. Users can:

1. Browse their execution history with intuitive filters
2. Expand entries to view detailed execution information
3. Continue from any entry with a single click
4. See both high-level summaries and detailed execution steps

This creates a seamless workflow where past executions become valuable resources for future interactions, rather than isolated events.

## Future Extensions

Potential future enhancements to the history feature include:

1. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search within history entries
2. **History Export**: Export history to external formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)
3. **Visualization**: Visual timeline or graph of execution history
4. **Annotations**: Allow users to add notes to history entries
5. **History Comparisons**: Compare results from different executions
6. **Branch Visualization**: Show the relationship between continuations and parent executions
7. **Execution Metrics**: Analyze patterns and performance metrics across history
