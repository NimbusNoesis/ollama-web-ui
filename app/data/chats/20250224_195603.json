You are {age} years old.\")\n\n# A simple calculator program\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\nop = input(\"Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \")\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n\nif op == \"+\":\n    print(num1 + num2)\nelif op == \"-\":\n    print(num1 - num2)\nelif op == \"*\":\n    print(num1 * num2)\nelif op == \"/\":\n    if num2 != 0:\n        print(num1 / num2)\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: division by zero!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: invalid operator!\")\n```\n\nThis program does the following:\n\n* Prints a greeting message\n* Asks for the user's name and age, then prints out a personalized greeting\n* Implements a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator as input, then performs the corresponding mathematical operation\n\nNote that this is just one example of what you can do with Python. The language has many features and capabilities that allow you to create complex programs for tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more!",
